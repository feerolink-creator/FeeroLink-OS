Layer Transcend OS — A cognitive architecture for shared observation and resonance.

# FeeroLink OS — The Principle of Layer Transcend

**FeeroLink OS** is a visual thinking-based, structure-aware cognitive system  
designed to understand the universe through **observation, structure, and resonance**.

---

## Introduction: This OS begins with a question

> **When we change the way we perceive, we change what we see.**  
> What was once invisible may begin to emerge,  
> and perhaps we can grasp a deeper truth of the universe.

## Core Principles

- **Layer Transcend**  
　The leap of meaning: an image rises, gains structure, and becomes a universe

- **Layer Observer Theory**  
　Differences in recognition stem from differences in observed layers.  
　By sharing what we see, we build a resonant universe.

- **Visual Relativist OS**  
　A system where "gravitational meaning" floats images upward,  
　and observation reshapes reality — a visual form of relativity
