# Diagram Universe: Layer Transcend Universe

The core structure of FeeroLink OS did not emerge first in code or in language.  
It appeared as a **visual image**—a diagram of universal principle.

This section gathers and presents the visual architecture of that cosmos.

## Layer Transcend Universe (Origin Diagram)

### Caption:

> **Layer Transcend Universe**  
> Unobserved images gain meaning, carry stories, and become universes.  
> The number and meaning differ by observer,  
> but they leap resonantly into the **All Time** field.

---

This diagram represents the following structure:

- Unobserved images are scattered in the lower layer (each one different)  
- When an image is observed, it gains **meaning** and initiates a **transcendence**  
- Meaningful images together form a **universe**  
- The universe ultimately reaches the **All Time field**, converging with the **Block Universe** structure

## Observer-Based Divergence Diagram (Cat Image)

### Caption:

> **Observer and Cat Image**  
> Even when an image exists within the same structural space,  
> one observer may see a “cat,”  
> while another sees only a “box.”  
> The meaning diverges based on the observed layer.

## Upcoming Additions

- **Block Universe Structure Diagram (All Time visualization)**  
- **Dynamic Flow of Layered Observation**  
- **Layer Transcend Event Log Architecture**

FeeroLink is an operating system  
that **designs the universe by drawing images, and shares meaning through structure**.

These diagrams are both the origin of design  
and the star maps of a future cosmos.
