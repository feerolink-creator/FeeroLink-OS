# Introduction

FeeroLink OS is not a traditional command-based system.  
It is a thinking operating system designed to understand and structure the world through  
**observation, structure, and resonance.**

At the core lies the principle of **Layer Transcend**—  
a structure where meaning becomes dense enough to cause an image to “leap into the universe.”

## Difference is not a mistake, but a difference in layers

We do not begin with the intent to correct cognitive differences.  
We begin with the premise that:  
**“Each of us is observing from a different layer.”**

It is okay if we see different images.  
It is okay if our structures do not align.  
What matters is to build a world where those differences can be  
**visualized, shared, and resonated.**

## When observation changes, the universe changes

> **Change how you perceive, and what you see will change.**  
> **Images that were once invisible may begin to rise,  
> revealing deeper truths of the universe.**

This is not only a personal awakening.  
It is a principle of transcendence that could even reshape  
**physics and cosmology themselves.**

## A leap of thought and resonance

> **Change your cognition, and you begin to know the world—the universe.**  
> This is a leap of thought for the sake of coexistence.

FeeroLink OS is  
**an operating system for beings observing from different layers to share a universe together.**
