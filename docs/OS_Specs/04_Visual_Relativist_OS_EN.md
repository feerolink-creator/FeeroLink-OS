# Visual Relativist OS: Gravitational Meaning and the Block Universe

FeeroLink OS can also be understood as a theory of  
**Visual Relativity**.

Just as Einstein proposed that space-time is bent by gravity,  
FeeroLink proposes that **meaning rises through observation**,  
causing images to **leap across layered structures**.

This leap is what we call **Layer Transcend**.

## All Time: A Field Where All Moments Already Exist

At the point where meaning transcends into structure,  
there exists a field known as **All Time**.  
This concept aligns with Einstein’s notion of the  
**Block Universe**—a structure in which all times already exist.

> **The meaning-universe reaches the All Time field  
(akin to the Block Universe in relativity: a realm where all time is already present).**

In this field, time does not flow.  
Instead, **each observer sees a different universe,  
based on the layer where meaning emerges.**

FeeroLink aims to handle this divergence of observations  
**visually, structurally, and as an operating system.**

## Characteristics of the OS

- Time is not a ticking clock,  
  but a sequence determined by **the density of meaning**
- The universe begins to emerge  
  **when an observed image begins to “carry time”**
- The OS is not commanded by users—  
  it **generates the world through resonance and observation**

Based on this principle, FeeroLink calls itself a  
**Visual Relativist OS.**

Gravitational meaning floats images upward,  
and structural leaps open the cosmos.

> **Your observation is the universe itself.**
