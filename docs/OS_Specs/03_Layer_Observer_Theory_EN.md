# Layer Observer Theory

FeeroLink OS begins with a simple yet powerful premise:  
**Every being observes a different layer.**

One observer may see a **cat**.  
Another may see only an **empty box**.

This difference is not a mistake or misrecognition.  
Each observer is simply **perceiving a different layer** of reality.

This structure is illustrated in the following diagram.

### Example: Observer and Cat Image

In a given layer, a meaningful image (in this case, a cat) may emerge.  
However, whether or not that image is “seen” depends on  
**the position of the observer** within the layered system.

This principle forms the foundation of **resonance design** in FeeroLink OS.

> **The goal is not to unify all perspectives,  
> but to share different observations  
> and understand the universe through resonance.**

Different viewpoints are not collisions.  
They are **expressions of structural multiplicity**.

FeeroLink OS is the system that makes these differences **visible, recordable, and shareable** through layered cognition.
