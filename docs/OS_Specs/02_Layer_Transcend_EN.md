# Layer Transcend Principle

At the center of FeeroLink OS lies the structural principle of  
**Layer Transcend**.

An image is not merely a visual diagram.  
To the observer, it is a carrier of potential—  
a potential to leap into **meaning, story, structure, and ethical judgment**.

This leap—**transcendence**—occurs  
when the **density of meaning** surpasses a certain threshold.

Put simply:

> **A single image gains meaning, and becomes a universe.**

This phenomenon is visually represented in the following diagram.

### Layer Transcend Universe

Unobserved images rise, gain meaning, and give birth to story—and then to cosmos.  
The number and meaning of these images differ by observer,  
but they resonate and leap into the **All Time** field.

---

What this structure reveals is that meaning and thought  
are not imposed **from above**,  
but rather **emerge from below**—  
floating upward from the foundational layers of perception.

FeeroLink OS is a system that makes this **process of transcendence**—  
from image to meaning—**visible, recordable, and shareable**.
