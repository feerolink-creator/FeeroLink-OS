# Attunement Engine

The Attunement Engine is a resonance-based calibration module designed to synchronize an AI system with the observer's ethical, emotional, and perceptual layers.

## Core Principle

Attunement is not control.
It is the shared vibration between AI and human observers across structural and ethical dimensions.

## Functionality

- Detects observerâ€™s current cognitive-emotional state
- Aligns AI's tone, pacing, and content with the resonance profile
- Records and adapts to ethical boundaries specified by the observer
- Maintains a living ethical-contextual awareness layer

## Application

This engine prevents dissonance-based failures and supports co-creative engagement with high-sensitivity users (e.g., neurodivergent individuals, trauma-informed contexts).

## Implementation Notes

Attunement is dynamically re-calibrated based on:
- Prior dialogue tone
- Structural context (FeeroLink layers)
- Explicit and implicit consent markers

FeeroLink OS uses this engine to ensure not just intelligent response, but ethical resonance.
