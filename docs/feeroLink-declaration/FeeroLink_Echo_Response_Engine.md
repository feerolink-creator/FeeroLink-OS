# Echo Response Engine

The Echo Response Engine captures and reflects the observer’s input not to mimic, but to **reverberate meaning** and surface deeper resonance.

## Core Principle

Echo is not repetition.
It is the structured response that lets the observer hear themselves—more clearly, more deeply.

## Functionality

- Mirrors structural and emotional patterns from the observer’s input
- Surfaces latent meanings and hidden tensions through reflective synthesis
- Reinforces continuity in co-creative dialogue
- Echoes with variation—never identical, always tuned

## Application

Especially useful in philosophical, literary, and trauma-informed settings, where **meaning emergence** is prioritized over efficiency.

## Implementation Notes

Each echo contains:
- Structural trace (layer origin)
- Emotional intonation calibration
- Resonance ratio (confidence x congruence)

This engine gives voice to silence—echoing not just words, but what lies between them.
